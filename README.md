# FortWars Map Archive

## Sources:
- [Archive.org dump](https://archive.org/details/FortWars)
- [Reddit dump](https://archive.org/details/FortWars)
- SW's HUGE backup (private)
- Our own FW repo. NOTE: We had some maps under content-compressed/ that weren't available under maps/. I copied over any unique maps, but can't remember what I did with any differing maps.

## Subdirectories
- mapsrc/* - vmf files for use in Hammer. I cleaned out any map compilation biproducts (.vmx. .log, etc). Let me know if you need them for some reason.
- alt/* - maps with differing checksums to those at the top level.
- crashers/* - maps that crash, either immediately or shortly after spawning.
- thumb/* - thumbnails. There may be some that I missed, and I did overwrite at least one without placing the original in a alt folder, but I consdier archiving these low-priority.

## FAQ
- Q: I have an old hard drive with some maps on it-
- A: Say no more, just send everything to "millysoose" in the Darkland Servers Discord server. I will look through them. Or, if you prefer, pull requests are open.
