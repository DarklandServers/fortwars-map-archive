# FortWars Map Archive

## Sources:
- [Archive.org dump](https://archive.org/details/FortWars) Unknown uploader, random link found on the web.
- [SW's HUGE backup] Private URL, just a pile of all of his content he saved over the years.
- [Our own FW repo] NOTE: We had some maps under content-compressed that weren't available under maps. I copied over any unique maps, but can't remember what I did with any differing maps.
- [NewHaven] The last community that hosted FW before the Darkland Servers revive. So many new maps were made plus quite a few edits that we have since fixed up.
- [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/) Another website that holds random archived CS and HL2 maps that we converted to FW maps.
- [SourceForts](https://www.sourceforts.net/) Even the early days of Darkland Servers, most maps were based off of this mod for HL2.
- [CS-BG](https://maps.cs-bg.info/) Another website that holds random archived CS and HL2 maps that we converted to FW maps.
- [Game Maps](https://www.gamemaps.com/) Another website that holds random archived CS and HL2 maps that we converted to FW maps.
- [17 Buddies](https://www.17buddies.rocks/) Another website that holds random archived CS and HL2 maps that we converted to FW maps.
- [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/workshop/) Handful of ideas came from here, some maps were just simple enough to do a few edits and add the fortwars items.

## Subdirectories
- mapsrc/* - vmf files for use in Hammer. I cleaned out any map compilation biproducts (.vmx. .log, etc). Let me know if you need them for some reason.
- thumb/* - thumbnails. There may be some that I missed, and I did overwrite at least one without placing the original in a alt folder, but I consdier archiving these low-priority.
- wip/*	- work in progress maps or just test maps.

## FAQ
Q: I have an old hard drive with some maps on it-
A: Say no more, just send everything to "millysoose" in the Darkland Servers Discord server. I will look through them. Or, if you prefer, pull requests are open.

Q: How do I know what the latest version of these maps are?
A: Yeah we know, its kind of annoying to figure that out, the latest run on Darkland Servers renamed all the finished maps to have the _dl in the name.

Q: Did you guys make all of these maps your selves?
A: No, but yes. Its honestly about 50/50. Most maps users made for FW and others were edits/fixes to old maps that were found listed off our sources above.
